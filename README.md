Snaphe
======

Snaphe is a Web Data Extraction library written in PHP. The library includes several tools to make writing and executing of wrappers much simpler but does not offer any wrapper generation functionality.

The basic idea behind Snaphe is that a human can write more robust wrappers than an algorithm and that this is a not a very time consuming task if the developer has advanced knowledge of web technologies and if there are only few different templates. The second import aspect of Snaphe is that installation and deployment is fairly simple and fast. Wrappers can run on every server and client which has PHP installed.

Snaphe was written by Florian Eckerstorfer. It was the practical part of my bachelor thesis.
